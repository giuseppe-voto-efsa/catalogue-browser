    · Added debug config class for controlling beta and debugging functions
    · Added test function for allowing the import of terms from external
    files (only for beta tester or cat manager and MTX). The function take a
    txt file tab delimited and create new terms and put them into the
    tree/db. The code is uniquely generated.
    · Removed unused jar and added syntax for last jars “[curVersion, )”
    with maven
    · Added algorithm (to auto insertion of series of terms through txt)
    which is able to check in which hierarchy (in the catalogue) the child’s
    parent belongs to and hence adds the terms’ Reportability.
    · Created a custom algorithm for botanicals
    · Added ability to show until what line the algorithm was able to import
    terms in order to let the cat manager to solve eventually errors on the
    txt format file
    · Solved bug related to the update ICT db message which appears even
    with catalogue != MTX
    · Optimization of the ICT directories with the rest of the classes used
    in the cat bro. -> memory improvement
    · Removed check for (check and interpreting tool folders) since now the
    process is made once at launch time of the CB
    · The ICT db is now updated automatically when updating the MTX
    · The utils.zip file now will be extracted all in the ICT main folder
    · The install ICT has a new check if update.bat file is missing (in
    order to install last version)
    · Adding ability to logout when tool has saved the credentials; this
    because if the user change the pass and tries to open the tool for more
    than 3 times than the dcf will block the user
    · Created a drop down list with login/logout from DCF
    · Modified links of web services for Dama cloud (BETA testing)
    · Solved problems related with the refresh view when the user logout
    from the DCF
    · Removing the remember me option from login (since will be saved and
    the user can log out now)
    · The login window now wrap the content and it is not resizable and it
    appears close to main menu
    · Replaced the DCF soap links (Dama) with the old links since this will
    redirect to the Dama cloud
    · Starting first test for conversion to Win10 app
    · Add progress bar while downloading the ICT
    · Found bug in which the ICT db is not update if updating the one on
    catalogue browser (solved by calling the copyDb from ict class while
    exporting the new foodex2)
    · Added ability to update ICT db even if updating MTX in offline by
    importing the ecf file
    · Solved memory managment by solving a lot of memory leak problems (like
    buffer opened but not closed), changed the parameters when launching the
    tool; now when the tool is above 1,1Gb it just remove everything and
    goes back to the memory needed! The UI and all the program as well is
    much much responsive.
    · Fixed bug in which the download of the ICT followed by its
    installation were giving thread errors
    · Created a unique function for the export catalogue process used from
    different methods into the ToolsMenu class
    · Fixed all memory leaks in all projects when file reading/writing, db
    connections and url connections were not properly closed
    · Fixed all accessing static variable calling the this. Method which is
    better for refering to a certain obj outside the method
    · Starting to remove useless static methods/variables which are not
    removed from the memory from the GC when the execution is concluded
    · First test for new installer which is better managing the memory

    Added restrictions to adding facets
    
    If a term inherits some implicit facets with cardinality SINGLE
    from its parent, it is possible to override them in order to specify
    better the descriptors (even if the cardinality is single, in fact
    the parent facet descriptor will be overridden).Now it is only possible to
    select descriptors which are children of the parent descriptor
    in this case. Moreover, the search was enhanced in order to filter
    the search results if a root term is specified (all the terms
    which are not children of the root term will be excluded)

    Not in use hierarchies and default hierarchy features
    
    It is now possible to set a subset of hierarchies
    which are no more in use. These hierarchies will not be shown
    to the users (except for catalogue managers).
    
    It is now possible to set a default hierarchy, which is the
    hierarchy that is first shown to users when the catalogue is
    opened for the first time, and in general it is the main
    hierarchy.
    
    Syntax:
    
    To use these features you should insert in the scope notes
    of the catalogue the following things:
    
    - Default hierarchy:
    “catalogue scope notes$[defaultHierarchy=hierarchyCode]”
    
    - Not in use hierarchies:
    “catalogue scope notes$[notUsedHierarchies=hierarchyCode1,hierarchyCode2,…]”
    
    Note that you can also combine the two features, e.g.:
    
    "catalogue scope notes$[defaultHierarchy=hierarchyCode][notUsedHierarchies=hierarchyCode1,hierarchyCode2,…]”

    Double screen bug fix
    
    If:
    - two screen are used
    - a window is moved to non main screen
    - the window is closed in the non main screen (causing the save of the
    window position and dimensions)
    - the tool is subsequently run on a single screen mode and the same
    window as before is opened
    
    Then:
    The window will appear outside of the screen since its position was
    saved with the double screen mode
    
    This bug was fixed adjusting the window position to fit the single
    screen dimensions if a single screen is used. If multiple screens
    are used then no adjustment is done.

    If upload data is started, first a download process starts to move into

    Then the upload of that .xml is done through an upload catalogue file
    action.
    Now if the download process is started (i.e. we loop until we find the
    .xml file) and the application is closed before the upload cat file is
    performed, the tools saves the download process as an additional pending
    action, in order to restart the download when the application restarts.

    now the .xml which is created into the remote folder can be downloaded

    wait the file). If a new xml creation is requested while an old one was

    Link with sas procedure
    
    A new button named "Create .xml changes file" was created under the
    tools menu. This button allows sending the exported version of
    the current catalogue (.xlsx format) to the sas server.
    In particular, a .start file is created first and then, as soon as the
    copy is completed, it is renamed with the .xlsx extension (in order to
    avoid file system problems due to latencies). Moreover, a .end file
    is created in the end to warn the sas server that the .xlsx file is
    ready to be used.
    The sas server will recognize the .end file and then it will convert
    it into an .xml file which contains the differences between the loaded
    .xlsx catalogue and its official version, in terms of dcf operations
    (in order to be able to upload them with a single UploadCatalogueFile
    operation).

    In fact, it is now possible to define temporary terms by giving them
    a code like: TEMP_ + whatever we want. Note that an assumption of the
    program is that the temporary codes are unique among them, therefore
    be careful! Examples of temporary codes are TEMP_0, TEMP_1234, TEMP_salad,
    TEMP_123_ribes.
    
    Note that it is also possible to define the parent code
    of a temporary term with another temporary term. In fact, if you want
    to give to TEMP_1 the parent TEMP_parent_1 you can do it by
    setting as TEMP_1.parentCode the value TEMP_parent_1 in the
    hierarchy you want.
    
    IMPORTANT NOTE: if flag, order or reportable are left blank, they
    are automatically inferred. In fact, the flag is by default set to 1.
    The term is assumed reportable if not specified, and if an order is
    not specified, the term will get the first available order code among
    siblings under its parent.
    
    Note also that all these assumptions are also valid for non
    temporary terms!
    
    2) Solved an import bug which assumed the wrong db path for catalogues.
    
    BUGS:
    A bug seems to be present: if we start an unreserve action, sometimes
    the Dcf.java is not capable of finding the DefaultProperties.xml file
    raising an exception. Note that if the file is not found, the program
    will connect by default with the dcf TEST.

    Drag and drop bug fix
    
    The drag and drop procedure was fixed. In fact, the previous version
    usually generates negative order integer for terms.
    Moreover, the order integer of terms is now normalized, that is,
    the integer series of natural numbers is respected. E.g.
    if the orders are 1,4,5,7,8,10 the terms are indeed ordered but
    the numbers are not so good. So the procedure convert them into
    1,2,3,4,5,6. This is applied both for drag n drop and for cut/copy/paste
    operations.

    Import process improved
    
    The import process was subdivided in several classes in order to improve
    its modularity. In particular:
    - CatalogueSheetImporter imports the catalogue sheet
    - AttributeSheetImporter imports the attributes sheet
    - HierarchySheetImporter imports the hierarchies sheet
    - TermSheetImporter imports the terms sheet (only term information)
    
    - TermAttributeImporter imports the values of attributes contained in
    the term sheet (identified by the attributes names)
    
    - ParentImporter imports the parent-child relationships contained in
    the term sheet (identified by the hierarchies code + flag, parentCode,
    reportable, hierarchyCode, order)
    
    - NotesSheetImporter imports the release notes of the catalogues
    
    The base class of all these classes is SheetImporter.java which implements
    the common steps used in all the above classes.
    
    Moreover, also the TermTypeImporter was created to import the term types
    of the catalogue (if present). Note that this class does not extend
    the SheetImporter base class, because it has a different logic.

    Reserve process fixed
    
    The reserve process was ordered in a better way. Order:
     1- reserve request is sent
     2- log is retrieved (blocking step)
     3- checks are made on the log, we check if the reserve was successful,
         if we had sent a minor reserve for a draft major catalogue (this
         is an error) and if we have the last internal version of the catalogue
         or not.
     4- based on the checks we warn the user, and the last internal version
       of the catalogue is downloaded if needed
    
    If in 2 we find the dcf busy for a reserve operation,
    the editing is forced and we can edit at
    our own risk. When the dcf gives a response, we notify the user if the
    reserve was Ok or not. If not ok, it blocks the editing and warn the
    user that he must merge the changes with the new catalogue.

    Reserve logic changed
    
    The reserve logic is now changed. In fact, now the first thing the
    tool does is sending the reserve request. Then, we use several checks
    to control the validity of the reserve we made (e.g. correct internal
    version, no minor reserve on major drafts...)
    Based on the checks we perform some actions, and then
    the process of retrieving the Log document related
    to the reserve request starts. The process can be stopped whenever
    we want, in fact it will restart as we login into the dcf again.
    The important thing is that now the process is perfectly integrated
    without code duplication.
    The logic and the code are much easier now.
    
    Some bugs were fixed.
